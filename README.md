# Airbnb Project

- [Problem description](#problem-description)

### Objective

The goal of this project is to apply everything we have learned
in this de zoomcamp to build an end-to-end data pipeline.

## Problem description
Problem is well described and it's clear what the problem the project solves





## Data Pipeline 



## Technologies Used

* **Cloud**: GCP
* **Infrastructure as code (IaC)**: Terraform
* **Containarization**: Docker
* **Workflow orchestration**: Mage
* **Data Lake**: Google Cloud Storage
* **Data Warehouse**: BigQuery
* **Visualization**: Google Looker Studio
